📅 Day 4 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

🐍 Python Journey Continues!

Today I learned about **Operators** in Python — one of the most important building blocks for writing logic and performing calculations 🧠

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Understanding different types of operators:
  ➜ Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %, **, //)
  ➜ Comparison (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
  ➜ Logical (and, or, not)
  ➜ Assignment (=, +=, -=, *=, etc.)
- Writing short expressions to perform math and check conditions
- Using operators in simple if-else conditions

🔍 What I Learned:
- Operators connect logic and data — they make code actually “do” something!
- Learned how Python handles division (/, //) and exponentiation (**)
- Practiced combining multiple conditions with logical operators

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 4 completed!
Operators make programming logical and mathematical at the same time.
I’m starting to think like a programmer — breaking problems into smaller operations and conditions. 🔥

🎯 Next Target (Day 5):
➡️ Explore **Conditional Statements** — making decisions using if, elif, and else in Python!
