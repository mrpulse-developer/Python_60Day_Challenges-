📅 Day 8 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

🐍 Python Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Function Parameters and Variable Scope** in Python — understanding how data flows inside functions and how variables behave in different parts of the program! 🧠  

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Defining functions with **parameters** and **arguments**  
- Using **default parameter values**  
- Returning values from functions using `return`  
- Understanding **local vs global scope**  
- Learning how to modify global variables inside functions  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Parameters make functions flexible — we can pass different data every time we call them  
- Default values prevent errors and make code more user-friendly  
- Variables created inside a function (local) can’t be accessed outside  
- Global variables can be read anywhere, but to modify them, we use the `global` keyword  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 8 completed!  
This concept really helped me understand how Python handles variables and data within functions.  
Learning about scope made me realize how important variable organization is in larger programs.  

Feeling confident with how functions communicate and manage data now! ⚙️  

🎯 Next Target (Day 9):
➡️ Dive into **String Methods** — understanding how to store, access, and manipulate multiple values efficiently in Python.
