📅 Day 11 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

🐍 Python Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **List Basics** in Python — one of the most important data structures used to store and organize multiple values efficiently. 📦🐍  

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Creating lists using square brackets  
- Accessing elements using index values  
- Updating list items  
- Adding new items with append()  
- Slicing lists to get specific portions  
- Checking length using len()  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Lists are ordered and mutable, meaning values can be changed anytime  
- Indexing helps access specific items instantly (like fruits[0])  
- Slicing is useful when we want only a part of the list  
- append() makes it easy to grow a list dynamically  
- Lists can store mixed types — integers, strings, and even other lists  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 11 completed!  
Working with lists made me understand how Python manages collections of data.  
It felt great to manipulate, access, and update multiple values effortlessly in a single structure.  

🎯 Next Target (Day 12):
➡️ Explore **List Methods** — learning powerful operations like insert(), remove(), pop(), sort(), reverse(), count(), and more.
