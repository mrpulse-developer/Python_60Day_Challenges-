📅 Day 7 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻



🐍 Python Learning Journey Continues!



Today I explored **Functions** in Python — one of the most powerful features that makes code reusable, organized, and clean! 🧠  



🧩 Focus of the Day:

- Defining and calling custom functions using `def`  

- Using parameters and return statements  

- Learning about **default arguments**  

- Creating **nested functions** and returning functions  



🔍 What I Learned:

- Functions make code reusable and reduce repetition  

- `return` helps send data back from a function  

- Default parameters add flexibility when some arguments are optional  

- Nested functions can be used for advanced logic or closures  



💬 Reflection:

✅ Day 7 completed!  

Functions made me realize how powerful Python can be when logic is structured properly.  

It’s like giving my program reusable “skills” that it can call anytime! ⚡  



🎯 Next Target (Day 8):

➡️ Dive into **Function Parameters and Scope** — learning how to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently in Python!
