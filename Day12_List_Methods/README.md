📅 Day 12 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

🐍 Python Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **List Methods** in Python — powerful tools that help add, remove, search, sort, and modify list elements with ease. Lists are one of the most flexible and widely used data structures in Python! 📦✨

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Adding items using append(), insert(), and extend()
- Removing items using remove() and pop()
- Sorting and reversing lists
- Counting occurrences using count()
- Finding positions using index()

🔍 What I Learned:
- append() adds items at the end, while insert() adds them at any index
- remove() deletes a specific value, and pop() removes the last item by default
- sort() arranges values in ascending order, reverse() flips the list
- extend() is useful for adding multiple values at once
- Lists are extremely powerful and can handle dynamic data easily

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 12 completed!  
Working with list methods made me appreciate how efficient Python is for handling collections of data.  
These methods will be super useful in tasks like data cleaning, processing, and building real-world applications. 💪

🎯 Next Target (Day 13):
➡️ Explore **MINI PROJECT SIMPLE CALCULATOR** — understanding key-value pairs and how to store structured data.
