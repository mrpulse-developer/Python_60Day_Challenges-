📅 Day 14 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

🐍 Python Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Tuples and Sets** in Python — two powerful data structures that behave very differently but are extremely useful depending on the situation. 🧠✨

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Understanding **Tuples** (ordered + immutable)
- Accessing elements using indexes
- Tuple unpacking  
- Working with nested tuples  
- Using tuple methods like count() and index()

- Understanding **Sets** (unordered + unique values)
- Adding and removing items
- Checking membership with "in"
- Performing set operations:
  ➜ union()  
  ➜ intersection()  
  ➜ difference()  
- Removing duplicates using a set

🔍 What I Learned:
- Tuples are great for storing fixed data that should NOT change  
- Being immutable makes tuples safer and faster  
- Sets automatically remove duplicates — super useful for cleaning data  
- Set operations are powerful for comparing and filtering collections  
- Membership checking is faster in sets than lists

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 14 completed!  
Tuples and sets helped me understand how Python handles structured and unique data.  
It was interesting to see how each structure has a purpose based on immutability and uniqueness.  
Today’s concepts will be really helpful in data cleaning, comparisons, and efficient lookups. 💪

🎯 Next Target (Day 15):
➡️ Explore **Dictionaries** — key-value pairs and one of Python’s most powerful data types!
