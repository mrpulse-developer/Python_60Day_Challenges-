# 🐍 Variables (Day 02)

## 📘 Description
In Python, **variables** are used to store data values.  
Unlike other programming languages, Python doesn’t require you to declare the data type —  
it automatically detects it based on the value you assign. 🎯  

You can think of a variable as a **container** or a **label** that holds some information.  
Python also supports **constants**, which are written in uppercase letters (by convention).

## 💻 Code
```python
# 👋 Hello from Day 2 - Variables in Python
print("Hello, Pythonista! 🐍")

# 🧩 Creating variables
name = "John Doe"         # String
age = 21                  # Integer
height = 5.9              # Float
is_student = True         # Boolean

# 🧱 Constants (written in uppercase by convention)
PI = 3.14159
APP_NAME = "Python Challenge"

# 🧾 Printing all variable values
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is Student:", is_student)
print("Constant PI:", PI)
print("App Name:", APP_NAME)
