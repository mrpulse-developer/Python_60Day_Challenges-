📅 Day 6 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

🐍 Python Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Loops** in Python — one of the most useful tools that help automate repetitive tasks efficiently! 🔁  

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Understanding how **for** and **while** loops work  
- Looping through lists and strings  
- Using **break** and **continue** to control the loop flow  
- Practicing simple patterns and nested loops  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Loops make programs more dynamic and powerful by handling repetition automatically  
- The **for loop** is perfect for iterating through sequences (like lists or strings)  
- The **while loop** runs until a condition becomes false — great for user-driven logic  
- **break** helps stop a loop early, while **continue** skips a specific iteration  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 6 completed!  
Writing loops felt like giving Python a rhythm — it repeats actions, checks conditions, and keeps running smoothly. 🔁  
Understanding loops gave me the confidence to handle logic that involves repetition with ease! 💪  

🎯 Next Target (Day 7):
➡️ Dive into **Functions** — reusable blocks of logic that make programs cleaner, faster, and easier to maintain!
