📅 Day 10 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

🐍 Python Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **Number and Math Methods** in Python — essential tools for calculations, rounding, formatting, and generating random values. 🔢⚙️  

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Rounding numbers using round()  
- Converting between int, float, and strings  
- Using math functions like sqrt(), pow(), floor(), ceil()  
- Working with abs() to get absolute values  
- Using the random module for random() and randint()  
- Picking a random item using random.choice()  

🔍 What I Learned:
- Python’s math module gives access to powerful mathematical tools  
- round() is super useful for financial and decimal calculations  
- random.randint() is perfect for games, OTP, and simulation tasks  
- math.floor() and math.ceil() help handle precise rounding logic  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 10 completed!  
Numbers are everywhere in real applications — and Python makes handling them clean and simple.  
Today’s learning made me feel more confident about implementing real-world logic. 💪  

🎯 Next Target (Day 11):
➡️ Explore **List Basic** in Python — understanding how data changes between int, float, string & bool.
