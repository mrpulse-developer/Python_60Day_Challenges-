📅 Day 5 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

🐍 Python Journey Continues!

Today I learned about **Conditional Statements** in Python — the logic that helps programs make decisions based on conditions! 🧠

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Understanding how `if`, `elif`, and `else` work
- Writing programs that make choices dynamically
- Using **comparison** and **logical operators** in conditions
- Practicing short forms using Python’s **ternary operator**

🔍 What I Learned:
- Conditions help control the flow of the program — like real decision-making
- `elif` makes code cleaner instead of chaining multiple if statements
- Nested conditions can be used for multi-level decision logic
- The ternary operator allows quick, one-line conditional expressions

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 5 completed!
Writing logic-based programs felt like giving “brains” to my code. 🧠  
It was fun to see Python make choices depending on the inputs and conditions!  
Each day, I’m getting better at combining logic and creativity. 💪

🎯 Next Target (Day 6):
➡️ Explore **Loops** — repeating actions efficiently using `for` and `while` loops in Python!
