📅 Day 9 of 60 | #100DaysOfCode Challenge 💻

🐍 Python Learning Journey Continues!

Today I explored **String Methods** in Python — powerful tools to clean, format, and analyze text efficiently! ✨  

🧩 Focus of the Day:
- Finding the length of a string  
- Changing case using upper(), lower(), title()  
- Removing extra spaces with strip(), lstrip(), rstrip()  
- Searching inside strings using find(), startswith(), endswith()  
- Replacing text with replace()  
- Splitting and joining text  
- Accessing characters and slicing  

🔍 What I Learned:
- String methods make text handling extremely easy and readable  
- strip() is super useful for cleaning user input  
- split() and join() can convert text into lists and back  
- Python has very intuitive and beginner-friendly string functions  

💬 Reflection:
✅ Day 9 completed!  
Working with string methods made Python feel powerful yet simple.  
Understanding these tools is essential for text processing, cleaning data, and building user-friendly programs.  

🎯 Next Target (Day 10):
➡️ Dive into **Number Methods & Math Operations** — handling numeric data with precision.
